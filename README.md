# reservations

[Live Link](https://reservations-frontend.vercel.app/dashboard)


A project completed as part of my Thinkful curriculum. This is an application to create and manage reservations for a restaurant.

## tools used:

- React (with functional components and hooks)
- JavaScript
- GitHub
- Vercel
- Jest

## prompt:

You have been hired as a full stack developer at Periodic Tables, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation. At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

## learning objectives:

- Develop a front end using React Functional Components
- Develop a RESTful API using Node, Express
- Create a PostgreSQL database
- Utilize an outside in full-stack workflow
- Practice a test-driven development methodology
- Use CI / CD through Vercel and a GitHub monorepo with automated deployment
- Work through user stories with Agile methodologies using a Kanban based system

## takeaways:

- Completing the user stories of this project with a full stack workflow was immensely satisfying as it all came together
- Deploying to Vercel at the start of the project and operating with a CI / CD mindset helped me integrate new features and ensure new bugs weren't introduced
- At some point I will revisit this to make it more mobile-friendly, perhaps keeping reservations in cards instead of a table
